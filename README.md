# how to run

in your virtualenv run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `make up` to see 
the web application running on `localhost:8000`. Only docker-compose required for this step.

# tests

run `make tests` to execute the unittests for the roman calculator (check requirements). Creating integration
tests for the roman calculator frontend would have been a must have but it requires much more time.

# task 1

It is implemented in golang as it is a bit simpler than the second task and can be executed
with `make task_1`. An alternative to installing golang in your laptop -> https://play.golang.org/
